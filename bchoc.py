    bchoc add -c case_id -i item_id [-i item_id ...]
    Add a new evidence item to the blockchain and associate it with the given case identifier.
    For usersâ€™ convenience, more than one item_id may be given at a time, which will create a 
    blockchain entry for each item without the need to enter the case_id multiple times. The state 
    of a newly added item is CHECKEDIN. The given evidence ID must be unique 
    (i.e., not already used in the blockchain) to be accepted.

    '''
    bchoc checkout -i item_id
    Add a new checkout entry to the chain of custody for the given evidence item. Checkout actions 
    may only be performed on evidence items that have already been added to the blockchain.

    bchoc checkin -i item_id
    Add a new checkin entry to the chain of custody for the given evidence item. Checkin actions may
    only be performed on evidence items that have already been added to the blockchain.

    bchoc remove -i item_id -y reason [-o owner]
    Prevents any further action from being taken on the evidence item specified. The specified
    item must have a state of CHECKEDIN for the action to succeed.

    Sanity check. Only starts up and checks for the initial block.

    Parse the blockchain and validate all entries.
