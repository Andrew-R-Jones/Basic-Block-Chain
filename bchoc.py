bchoc add -c case_id -i item_id [-i item_id ...]
Add a new evidence item to the blockchain and associate it with the given case identifier.
For usersâ€™ convenience, more than one item_id may be given at a time, which will create a
blockchain entry for each item without the need to enter the case_id multiple times. The state
of a newly added item is CHECKEDIN. The given evidence ID must be unique
(i.e., not already used in the blockchain) to be accepted.

bchoc checkout -i item_id
Add a new checkout entry to the chain of custody for the given evidence item. Checkout actions
may only be performed on evidence items that have already been added to the blockchain.

Add a new checkin entry to the chain of custody for the given evidence item. Checkin actions may

Display the blockchain entries giving the oldest first (unless -r is given).
